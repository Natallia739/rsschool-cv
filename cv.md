Hello, Employer! I currently work at  in the real estate department as a Specialist of the 2nd category (I create, conclude and support real estate leases). However, I am 99% ready to try my hand at something new. I am well-versed in the Belarusian legislation, fairly quickly find common language with contractors and adjust to new realities :) I easily adapt in collective and unusual conditions. I prefer a remote work. I will be glad to hear from you!
